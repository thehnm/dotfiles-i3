<a href="#l9" class="line" id="l9">      9</a> 
<a href="#l10" class="line" id="l10">     10</a>   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<a href="#l11" class="line" id="l11">     11</a> software and other kinds of works.
<a href="#l12" class="line" id="l12">     12</a> 
<a href="#l13" class="line" id="l13">     13</a>   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<a href="#l14" class="line" id="l14">     14</a> to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<a href="#l15" class="line" id="l15">     15</a> the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<a href="#l16" class="line" id="l16">     16</a> share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<a href="#l17" class="line" id="l17">     17</a> software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<a href="#l18" class="line" id="l18">     18</a> GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<a href="#l19" class="line" id="l19">     19</a> any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<a href="#l20" class="line" id="l20">     20</a> your programs, too.
<a href="#l21" class="line" id="l21">     21</a> 
<a href="#l22" class="line" id="l22">     22</a>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<a href="#l23" class="line" id="l23">     23</a> price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<a href="#l24" class="line" id="l24">     24</a> have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<a href="#l25" class="line" id="l25">     25</a> them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<a href="#l26" class="line" id="l26">     26</a> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<a href="#l27" class="line" id="l27">     27</a> free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<a href="#l28" class="line" id="l28">     28</a> 
<a href="#l29" class="line" id="l29">     29</a>   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<a href="#l30" class="line" id="l30">     30</a> these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<a href="#l31" class="line" id="l31">     31</a> certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<a href="#l32" class="line" id="l32">     32</a> you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<a href="#l33" class="line" id="l33">     33</a> 
<a href="#l34" class="line" id="l34">     34</a>   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<a href="#l35" class="line" id="l35">     35</a> gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<a href="#l36" class="line" id="l36">     36</a> freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<a href="#l37" class="line" id="l37">     37</a> or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<a href="#l38" class="line" id="l38">     38</a> know their rights.
<a href="#l39" class="line" id="l39">     39</a> 
<a href="#l40" class="line" id="l40">     40</a>   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<a href="#l41" class="line" id="l41">     41</a> (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<a href="#l42" class="line" id="l42">     42</a> giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<a href="#l43" class="line" id="l43">     43</a> 
<a href="#l44" class="line" id="l44">     44</a>   For the developers&#39; and authors&#39; protection, the GPL clearly explains
<a href="#l45" class="line" id="l45">     45</a> that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users&#39; and
<a href="#l46" class="line" id="l46">     46</a> authors&#39; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<a href="#l47" class="line" id="l47">     47</a> changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<a href="#l48" class="line" id="l48">     48</a> authors of previous versions.
<a href="#l49" class="line" id="l49">     49</a> 
<a href="#l50" class="line" id="l50">     50</a>   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<a href="#l51" class="line" id="l51">     51</a> modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<a href="#l52" class="line" id="l52">     52</a> can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<a href="#l53" class="line" id="l53">     53</a> protecting users&#39; freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<a href="#l54" class="line" id="l54">     54</a> pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<a href="#l55" class="line" id="l55">     55</a> use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<a href="#l56" class="line" id="l56">     56</a> have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<a href="#l57" class="line" id="l57">     57</a> products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<a href="#l58" class="line" id="l58">     58</a> stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<a href="#l59" class="line" id="l59">     59</a> of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<a href="#l60" class="line" id="l60">     60</a> 
<a href="#l61" class="line" id="l61">     61</a>   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<a href="#l62" class="line" id="l62">     62</a> States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<a href="#l63" class="line" id="l63">     63</a> software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<a href="#l64" class="line" id="l64">     64</a> avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<a href="#l65" class="line" id="l65">     65</a> make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<a href="#l66" class="line" id="l66">     66</a> patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<a href="#l67" class="line" id="l67">     67</a> 
<a href="#l68" class="line" id="l68">     68</a>   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<a href="#l69" class="line" id="l69">     69</a> modification follow.
<a href="#l70" class="line" id="l70">     70</a> 
<a href="#l71" class="line" id="l71">     71</a>                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<a href="#l72" class="line" id="l72">     72</a> 
<a href="#l73" class="line" id="l73">     73</a>   0. Definitions.

<a href="#l75" class="line" id="l75">     75</a>   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

<a href="#l77" class="line" id="l77">     77</a>   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<a href="#l78" class="line" id="l78">     78</a> works, such as semiconductor masks.
<a href="#l79" class="line" id="l79">     79</a> 
<a href="#l80" class="line" id="l80">     80</a>   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<a href="#l81" class="line" id="l81">     81</a> License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
<a href="#l82" class="line" id="l82">     82</a> &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
<a href="#l83" class="line" id="l83">     83</a> 
<a href="#l84" class="line" id="l84">     84</a>   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<a href="#l85" class="line" id="l85">     85</a> in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<a href="#l86" class="line" id="l86">     86</a> exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
<a href="#l87" class="line" id="l87">     87</a> earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
<a href="#l88" class="line" id="l88">     88</a> 
<a href="#l89" class="line" id="l89">     89</a>   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based

<a href="#l91" class="line" id="l91">     91</a> 
<a href="#l92" class="line" id="l92">     92</a>   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
<a href="#l93" class="line" id="l93">     93</a> permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<a href="#l94" class="line" id="l94">     94</a> infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<a href="#l95" class="line" id="l95">     95</a> computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<a href="#l96" class="line" id="l96">     96</a> distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<a href="#l97" class="line" id="l97">     97</a> public, and in some countries other activities as well.

<a href="#l99" class="line" id="l99">     99</a>   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<a href="#l100" class="line" id="l100">    100</a> parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<a href="#l101" class="line" id="l101">    101</a> a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

<a href="#l103" class="line" id="l103">    103</a>   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;

<a href="#l105" class="line" id="l105">    105</a> feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<a href="#l106" class="line" id="l106">    106</a> tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<a href="#l107" class="line" id="l107">    107</a> extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<a href="#l108" class="line" id="l108">    108</a> work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<a href="#l109" class="line" id="l109">    109</a> the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<a href="#l110" class="line" id="l110">    110</a> menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

<a href="#l114" class="line" id="l114">    114</a>   The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
<a href="#l115" class="line" id="l115">    115</a> for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
<a href="#l116" class="line" id="l116">    116</a> form of a work.

<a href="#l118" class="line" id="l118">    118</a>   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official

<a href="#l120" class="line" id="l120">    120</a> interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<a href="#l121" class="line" id="l121">    121</a> is widely used among developers working in that language.

<a href="#l125" class="line" id="l125">    125</a> packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<a href="#l126" class="line" id="l126">    126</a> Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that

<a href="#l128" class="line" id="l128">    128</a> implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<a href="#l129" class="line" id="l129">    129</a> &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
<a href="#l130" class="line" id="l130">    130</a> (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<a href="#l131" class="line" id="l131">    131</a> (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<a href="#l132" class="line" id="l132">    132</a> produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<a href="#l133" class="line" id="l133">    133</a> 
<a href="#l134" class="line" id="l134">    134</a>   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
<a href="#l135" class="line" id="l135">    135</a> the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<a href="#l136" class="line" id="l136">    136</a> work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to

<a href="#l140" class="line" id="l140">    140</a> which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source

<a href="#l142" class="line" id="l142">    142</a> the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<a href="#l143" class="line" id="l143">    143</a> linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,

<a href="#l283" class="line" id="l283">    283</a>     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
<a href="#l284" class="line" id="l284">    284</a>     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
<a href="#l285" class="line" id="l285">    285</a>     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
<a href="#l286" class="line" id="l286">    286</a>     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
